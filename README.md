## Our Project Idea

When having a wedding, many people like to have a wedding registry so the guests that want to get gifts for the happy couple know what they want and can get them a gift they know they are going to treasure. A member of our team had some friends get married recently and found there wasn't a good option online to create a digital wedding registry.

For our project, we decided to build web application that let's users create a wedding registry with gifts that they can add from any online or physical store. They can then choose a custom url that they send their guests so their guests can purchase those gifts for the wedding.

## MVP

The MVP should satisfy these user stories:

1. I should be able to sign up a new account, and log in.
2. As a user, I should be able to create a wedding registry. Saving data such as a title, wedding description, the date of the wedding and a custom url that my guests will be able to visit.
3. As a user, I should be able to create multiple gifts. Saving data such as a title, description, image, price etc.
4. As a user, I should not be able to view/edit any of the gifts for any other registry, only my own.
5. As a guest, I should be able to visit the custom url specified by the registres custom url value without needing a login.
6. As a guest, I should be able to purchase a gift, or donate money towards part of a gift.
7. As a guest, I should be able to leave a message for the wedding couple when purchasing a gift.

### Stretch goals/Bonus features

- Make the registry an iFrame so it can be embedded into another website
- Allow users to design their own home page content
- Send alert (email?) to user when someone buys a gift
    - Could use nodemailer
    - Send a thank you to the buyer
    - Notification to receiver
- Themes
    - Let users have custom urls for their registry
        - Start with editable endpoint (ex: https://v16bears4weddings.com/danielandco)
    - Use CSS variables to hold color palettes? (sorry IE users)
- set a start and end date for when the registry is active
- Allow for partial payments of a gift,
    - GoFundMe style section for particular gifts - i.e. honeymoon, house deposit, etc…
- Create a cart that you can add items to before purchasing
    - Call ‘dibs’ on purchasing an item
    - If it’s in someone’s cart, show other users that that item is pending purchase
- Payment structure (5 items for free, unlimited items for $40, unlimited items + unique url for $80)
- Wedding RSVPs
- Chrome extension
    - Adds the items to your registry
    - When clicking the button, it would grab the image, price, title, url, and description
        - Auto-populate the add items popup with this information or leave blank
        - User can edit or fill in missing info before submitting to registry  
- Cash fund (with target goal, optional)
    - For house, honeymoon, home appliances, couple’s massage, etc.
- Add a “suggested items” section based on user’s current registry items (sponsored advertising space potential?)
- Import existing wishlists from other registries
- Allows you to make public and private lists for family and friends (reception vs ceremony friends..?) 
- Rank gift items based on how much you want them

# Project Review

We successfully completed our MVP on time. We also completed one of our stretch goals which was to add a payment page for users, where they can view all of the payments that have been made by guests.

### Things to note:


### .env file you'll need to run locally
